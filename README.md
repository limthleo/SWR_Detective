# SWR_Detective
by Tae Ho Lim, Nov. 2024.
A wavelet-based SWR (sharp-wave ripple) detection algorithm.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository into your local drive and run Detective_Pipeline. This was tested on MATLAB 2023b and requires the Signal Processing and Image Processing Toolboxes.
To run this algorithm, it requires an LFP trace, its sampling rate, and a velocity vector. Add .../SWR_Detective/helpers to your path and run Detective_Pipeline.m. Tweak the parameters to better fit your data and feel free to modify the code to your liking. 
SWR_Character is used to further characterise your validated events.
Enjoy!
